h1. MongoDoc

Version: 0.6.29 2011/05/17

I use MongoDoc in production on my own apps, and have been using (lightly)
MongoMapper and (heavily) Mongoid since 2009. By Summer 2010, I had come to the
conclusion that something more 'native' was the right way to go, and I began
to use more and more features of MongoDB directly in my code. After more than
six months, I am convinced that 'native' is the right approach.

I considered changing MongoDoc to match this 'native' approach, even going so
far as commiting to it in an email on September 4th, 2010 (Oy!). Instead, I
slowed down and have finally decided to stop further development of MongoDoc. I
will make bugfixes to MongoDoc as needed, but will no longer be adding features
(excepting some that had not yet been pushed to the public repo).

If you want a full-featured ODM for Ruby, take a look at
"mongoid":https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid .
