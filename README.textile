h1. MongoDoc

Version: 0.6.30 2011/06/18

MongoDoc is not actively supported.

I have been using MongoMapper (lightly) and Mongoid (heavily) since 2009. By June 2010, I had come to the conclusion that something more 'native' was the right way to go, and I began to use more and more features of MongoDB directly in my code irrespective of which ODM I was using (Mongoid, MongoDoc, or MongoMapper). After more than six months, I am convinced that 'native' is the right approach.

I will no longer be actively maintaining MongoDoc.

If you want a full-featured ODM for Ruby, take a look at "mongoid":https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid .
