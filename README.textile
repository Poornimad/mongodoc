h1. MongoDoc

Version: 0.6.30 2011/06/18

MongoDoc is not actively supported for anything but my own apps.

I use MongoDoc in production on my own apps, and have been using MongoMapper
(lightly) and Mongoid (heavily) since 2009. By June 2010, I had come to the
conclusion that something more 'native' was the right way to go, and I began to
use more and more features of MongoDB directly in my code irrespective of which
ODM I was using (Mongoid, MongoDoc, or MongoMapper). After more than six
months, I am convinced that 'native' is the right approach.

Instead I am no longer actively mainting MongoDoc. If I emailed you in the
summer of 2010 saying MongoDoc was going 'native', apologies.

If you want a full-featured ODM for Ruby, take a look at
"mongoid":https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid .
